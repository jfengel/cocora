    <h1>About Cocora</h1>
    <p>
        Cocora is a COVID-19 Compliance Ratings App. People can submit their review:
    </p>
    <p><img height="50" src="img/mask-good128.jpg" alt="Good"/> Pretty good compliance (almost everybody is wearing a mask
        correctly)
        and staying six feet apart.</p>
    <p><img height="50" src="img/mask-nose-128.jpg" alt="Fair"/>Not great, but most people are at least are making an
        attempt.</p>
    <p><img height="50" src="img/cough-128.jpg" alt="Bad"/>Bad. A lot of people unmasked, or wearing them wrong.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html">Wearing
        masks and
        keeping apart saves lives.</a>
        Yours, others, and people you care about. The only way to stop COVID-19 is to prevent it from spreading.
        That means
        keeping yourself from getting it, and avoiding spreading it yourself -- which you can do even if you
        don't have
        symptoms.

        Cocora is based on user input. It can help you pick where to go to be safer. We try to keep the data
        quality good,
        but use your common sense: wear a mask, keep your distance, and if people aren't complying, go some
        place else.

    <h2>Privacy policy</h2>
    <p>
        We require logins for ratings to try to keep data quality higher.
        We don't do anything with your data except to work
        out the average score. We don't sell it, share it, or send you emails. Logins are required solely to
        keep ratings
        to one per person, per site, per day.
    </p>
    <p>
        We don't record your name or email or anything else, just an ID, the location, and the rating.
        We try to protect your data, but can't absolutely guarantee security. If you have any concerns about
        your personal safety, don't submit any ratings.
