    <h1>About Cocora</h1>
    <p>
        Cocora is a COVID-19 Compliance Ratings App. People can submit their review:
    </p>
    <p><img height="50" src="img/mask-good128.jpg" alt="Good"/> Pretty good compliance (almost everybody is wearing a mask
        correctly)
        and staying six feet apart.</p>
    <p><img height="50" src="img/mask-nose-128.jpg" alt="Fair"/>Not great, but most people are at least are making an
        attempt.</p>
    <p><img height="50" src="img/cough-128.jpg" alt="Bad"/>Bad. A lot of people unmasked, or wearing them wrong.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html">Wearing
        masks and
        keeping apart saves lives.</a>
        Yours, others, and people you care about. The only way to stop COVID-19 is to prevent it from spreading.
        That means
        keeping yourself from getting it, and avoiding spreading it yourself -- which you can do even if you
        don't have
        symptoms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cocora is based on user input. It can help you pick where to go to be safer. We try to keep the data
        quality good,
        but use your common sense: wear a mask, keep your distance, and if people aren't complying, go some
        place else.

    <h2>Privacy policy</h2>
    <p>
        Cocora stores the ratings that you send to us and the locations that were rated,
        along with your user identifier and the
        date/time it was stored. We use that information to
        calculate an average rating for a location. We publish only the aggregate, not your individual ratings.
        Individual ratings are accessbile only by the server.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users can use Cocora without logging in. Logins are required only for ratings.
    </p>
    <p>
        We require logins for ratings to try to keep data quality higher.
        We do not sell it, share it, or send you emails. We do not record
        your name or email.
        Logins are required solely to
        keep ratings
        to one per person, per site, per day.
    </p>
    <p>
        Be aware that your user identifier is unique to you, so our data contains a list of places you have been,
        which is potentially sensitive. That data is kept privately on Cocora's servers, but while
        we try to protect your data, we cannot absolutely guarantee security. If you have any concerns about
        your personal safety, don't submit any ratings.
