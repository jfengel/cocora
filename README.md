Cocora -- a COVOID-19 mask compliance reporting app

## Setup

The hardcoded API key is restricted to working only at cocora.app. To work locally, 
create a .env.local with the line:

`REACT_APP_COCORA_PLACES_KEY=what you get from google`

Do not commit that file to the repository.

You'll need an unrestricted [Google Place API key](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key).
